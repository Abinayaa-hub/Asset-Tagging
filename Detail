What is Asset Tagging?
Asset tagging involves labeling physical items with distinct identification codes to enable easy tracking and management.These labels can be scanned or read to provide detailed information about each asset, such as its location, condition, owner, and service history.
Tagging is a foundational step in asset management software systems like SAMPATâ€™s Asset Management Software, where assets are tracked from procurement to retirement.
